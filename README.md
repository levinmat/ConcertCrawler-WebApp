# ConcertCrawler - Web App

Finds artists' live albums available on Spotify and displays them in chronological order.

Currently only available for Desktop (surely with Frontend/UX bugs) at [concert-crawler.herokuapp.com](https://concert-crawler.herokuapp.com/).

Powered by the Spotify Web API and Python wrapper Spotipy, as well as Flask, jQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap, Mustache, and Heroku for hosting.
